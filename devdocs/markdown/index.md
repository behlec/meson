# Developer documentation for the Meson Build system

## Overview

This is documentation for people interested in developing the
Meson Build system (as opposed to using it).

The documentation for uses can be found at
[the Meson homepage](http://mesonbuild.com).

See [here](index.md#Community) for information how to get in contact and
[here](index.md#Development) for more information on how to contribute.

## Features

## Community

There are two main methods of connecting with other Meson
developers. The first one is the mailing list, which is hosted at
[Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mesonbuild).

The second way is via IRC. The channel to use is `#mesonbuild` at
[Freenode](https://freenode.net/).

## Development

All development on Meson is done on the [GitHub
project](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson). Instructions for
contributing can be found on the [contribution page](http://mesonbuild.com/Contributing.html).

You do not need to sign a CLA to contribute to Meson.
